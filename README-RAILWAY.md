## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

- **Reactive Programming**: Spring WebFlux with Project Reactor
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers
- **Database**: MySQL with R2DBC for reactive access
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage build
- **Cloud Deployment**: Railway with automatic scaling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with 80%+ coverage

## üìà Performance Characteristics

- Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
- Reactive streams for backpressure handling
- Connection pooling for database optimization
- Average response time: < 100ms

## üîê Security

- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via R2DBC
- CORS configured for API access

## üö® Important Notes

### Redis Support
Railway's free tier does NOT include Redis. The application gracefully handles Redis absence:
- Cache operations are skipped
- All functionality remains available
- Performance impact is minimal for demo purposes

### Free Tier Limitations
- 500 hours/month execution time
- $5 usage credit (not charged)
- Apps sleep after ~5 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 5-10 seconds

**Note**: This is a demonstration deployment. For production use, additional configuration for security, rate limiting, and monitoring would be implemented.
